    Mathematics is my favorite subject as it presents plently of problems where I have to think logically. I enjoy thinking in this way and I find it satisfying once I find the solution. However, I also find it quite interesting that there are problems in math that nobody has been able to solve, even when the problems are quite simple.

      The Collatz Conjecture &#128196;

        The Collatz Conjecture is an unsolved math problem with simple rules.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with any number.</li>
        <li>If the number is even, half it.</li>
        <li>If the number is odd, triple it and add 1.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Here's an example of the process:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Step</td>
          <td>Number</td>
          <td>Reasoning</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>5 is the original number.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>16</td>
          <td>Since 5 is odd, It is tripled, and 1 is added to it.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>16 is halved since it's even.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>8 is also halved.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>4 is halved.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>Afier 1 is reached, it repeats in an endless loop.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        Do all numbers eventually lead to 1? Despite the fact that the average third grader can understand this problem, it has stumped some of the best mathemeticians in the world for decades.
